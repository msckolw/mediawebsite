      <h2>Understanding Media Bias</h2>
      <p>Media bias refers to the bias or perceived bias of journalists and news producers within the mass media in the selection of events, the stories that are reported, and how they are covered.</p>
      
      <h2>Types of Media Bias</h2>
      <h3>1. Selection Bias</h3>
      <p>The choice of which stories to cover and which to ignore can reflect bias. Some outlets may prioritize certain types of stories over others.</p>
      
      <h3>2. Framing Bias</h3>
      <p>How a story is presented, including the language used, the context provided, and the emphasis placed on different aspects.</p>
      
      <h3>3. Confirmation Bias</h3>
      <p>The tendency to search for, interpret, and present information in a way that confirms pre-existing beliefs.</p>
      
      <h3>4. Corporate Bias</h3>
      <p>Bias that may arise from corporate interests, advertising pressures, or ownership influences.</p>
